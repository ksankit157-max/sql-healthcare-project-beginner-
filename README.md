# SQL Healthcare Data Analysis â€“ Beginner Project

This project is a beginner-friendly SQL exercise where I explored patterns in a synthetic hospital dataset sourced from Kaggle. I used basic SQL functions like `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions like `AVG()` and `COUNT()` to derive insights.

## Objectives

- Analyze which **medical conditions** have the highest billing costs
- Identify **top hospitals** for emergency cases
- Find **doctors with the most patients**
- Understand **insurance-based billing trends**

## Files

- `queries.sql` â€“ My main SQL queries
- `screenshots/` â€“ Snapshots of query results
- `dataset_link.txt` â€“ Link to the Kaggle dataset used

## Tools Used

- [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) for writing and testing SQL queries
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/your-dataset-link) (synthetic)
- GitHub for version control and documentation

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

![Example Output](screenshots/avg_billing_by_condition.jpg)

##  Next Steps

- Incorporate subqueries and JOINs
- Visualize output using Tableau or Power BI
- Create dashboard from queries

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Filtering with `HAVING` vs `WHERE`
- Applying `GROUP BY` on multiple levels
- Structuring SQL queries for clarity
